# registry

Pull-only OCI registry proxy that serves images from GHCR under a custom domain.

This is similar in spirit to [archeio](https://github.com/kubernetes/registry.k8s.io/blob/main/cmd/archeio/README.md),
the proxy behind `registry.k8s.io`, but much simpler since we only need to front a single upstream registry.

## Why

**Vanity domain.** Publishing container images to `ghcr.io/arkeros/senku/redis` ties image references to a
specific hosting provider. A custom domain like `distroless.io/redis` decouples the public-facing image name
from the backend, so we can migrate to a different registry (GAR, ECR, self-hosted, etc.) without breaking
existing references.

**Minimal cost.** The proxy only handles metadata requests (manifests, tags). Blob requests — which make up
the vast majority of bandwidth — are redirected to the upstream registry, so the proxy never transfers
image layer data. This keeps Cloud Run costs near zero since blob traffic flows directly between the client
and GHCR.

## How it works

Manifests and tags are proxied (small metadata):

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant Proxy as Proxy (Cloud Run)
    participant GHCR

    Client->>Proxy: GET /v2/redis/manifests/latest
    Proxy->>GHCR: GET /v2/arkeros/senku/redis/manifests/latest
    GHCR-->>Proxy: 200 OK + manifest
    Proxy-->>Client: 200 OK + manifest
```

Blobs are redirected (large layer data never flows through the proxy).
GHCR redirects to `pkg-containers.githubusercontent.com`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Proxy as Proxy (Cloud Run)
    participant GHCR
    participant CDN

    Client->>Proxy: GET /v2/redis/blobs/sha256:deadbeef
    Proxy->>GHCR: GET /v2/arkeros/senku/redis/blobs/sha256:deadbeef
    GHCR-->>Proxy: 307 Location: CDN
    Proxy-->>Client: 307 Location: CDN
    Client->>CDN: GET blob data (direct, bypasses proxy)
    CDN-->>Client: 200 OK + blob data
```

The proxy:
1. Receives OCI Distribution API requests at `/v2/<name>/...`
2. Rewrites paths by prepending the repository prefix: `/v2/arkeros/senku/<name>/...`
3. Handles upstream auth transparently via the standard OCI token challenge flow
   (using [go-containerregistry](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry)'s transport)
4. Passes through redirect responses for blobs — the proxy never serves blob data itself,
   clients are redirected to the upstream's storage backend (CDN) directly

## Usage

```
registry --upstream=ghcr.io --repository-prefix=arkeros/senku --port=8080
```

## Supported endpoints

- `GET /v2/` — API version check
- `GET /v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>` — pull manifests
- `GET /v2/<name>/blobs/<digest>` — pull blobs (including redirect passthrough)
- `GET /v2/<name>/tags/list` — list tags

Push is not supported; images are pushed directly to GHCR via CI.

## Deployment

Deployed to Cloud Run (europe-west3) via kustomize manifests in `k8s/`.

```
bazel build //oci/cmd/registry/k8s
```

## Testing

```
bazel test //oci/pkg/proxy:proxy_test
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add OCI-compliant authentication (token challenge flow on `/v2/`) — the proxy is currently unauthenticated and exposed on the public internet
